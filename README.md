# A Safe Bayesian Optimization Algorithm for Tuning the Optical Synchronization System at European XFEL



## General

This repository contains the simulation code to reproduce the tables and figures presented in 

> J. O. LÃ¼bsen, C. Hespe, A. Eichler, "Safe Multi-Task Bayesian Optimization", submitted to the 6th Conference of Learning for dynamics and control, 2024

The code may be used as an safe multi-task Bayesian optimization framework to optimize arbitarily functions or to recreate and validate the figures from the paper.



## Prerequisites
## soon updated 
To run the scripts in this repository, you will need a working copy of the GPML toolbox (https://gitlab.com/hnickisch/gpml-matlab).
The code in this repository has been tested in the following environment:
